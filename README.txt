Hey there admin ;)

Here's a 'beta' version of the BBB procon ranks plugin. To install:

   1) Copy all the files and stuff (regular myBB plugin installation) to your myBB directory 
      on the webserver. ***Make sure to put all the files in the right directory (keep paths)!

   2) Go to AdminCP -> Configuration and install & activate the BBB Procon plugin.
   
  (!) 3) Go to Settings and go to Plugin Settings and change the Procon Settings. Insert stuff 
      you like to make the plugin work and save the settings.
   
   4) Go to <your myBB site>/procon.php in browser to test if it works.
   
   5) IF it works: create a link from your homepage (@our shit) to ./procon.php
      (for example: <a href="./procon.php">!rank</a> or something like that).
    
   6) Spin right round for ten minutes in a happy way.
   
   7) Buy Pablo a crate of beer and arrange some boobs :DD

Good luck!! :DDDDDDD

* This plugin is mainly made to give ranking data to the end-user which is 
* retrieved from the Procon database which is provided by the 
* "Chat, GUID, Stats and Mapstats Logger[1.0.0.2]" plugin which I will be referring 
* as logger plugin for simplicity's sake ;). The logger plugin reffered to is at:

* I do NOT own that project so credits for the logger plugin go to the developers of the 
* logger plugin. I solely made this plugin as an addition to the BBB website so end users
* can ask for ranks on the website. This plugin is distributed in the hope that it will be 
* useful, but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY. This plugin is free software. You are allowed to modify
